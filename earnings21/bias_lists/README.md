# Contextual Biasing Lists

This folder contains contextual biasing lists for the Earnings21 dataset. 

`oracle_list.txt` contains words and phrases found in the Earnings21 reference transcripts
`distractor_list.txt` includes all of `oracle_list.txt` with the addition of Fortune 500 company names and famous CEOs which are not found in Earnings21.  

These biasing lists were used in [Improving Contextual Recognition of Rare Words with an Alternate Spelling Prediction Model](https://arxiv.org/) (recently published in Interspeech 2022)!
